## Best Projects
- [3D Rendered Objects](Best%20Projects/3D%20Rendered%20Objects/main.py)
  This project can render outlined predefined shapes, such as a cube, a cone, and a sphere. It can display one permanently, or cycle between the shapes. The shape outlines can be any solid colour, or rainbow if specified. It also displays the FPS (165 cap by default, as my monitor is 165hz)

- [Image/Video to ASCII](Best%20Projects/Image%20Video%20to%20ASCII/main.py)
  This is probably my favourite project.
  This project converts either an image or a video (video must be very small) to an ASCII image with colours. When converting a video, it creates a temporary audio file and re-applies it at the end.

- [Number of Characters in File Chart](Best%20Projects/Number%20of%20Characters%20in%20File%20Chart/main.py)
  This project takes a file as an input, and displays the number of uppercase and lowercase letters, along with numbers, common characters, and unknown characters. This information is displayed on a chart.

## Revision Programs
- [Revision Quote Generator](Revision%20Programs/Revision%20Quote%20Generator/main.py)
  This project lets you create a .txt file to generate quotes, with randomly placed gaps in them (common words such as 'the' and 'was' are excluded from being replaced). I used this for my Religion and Philosophy GCSE. There is also a streak system to display how many quotes you have gotten correct in a row. There are key symbols such as '//' (not read by script), '/c' (for Christianity quotes), '/i' (for Islam quotes). You can select which religion you want to generate quotes for.

- [RGB Shift](Image%20Manipulation/RGB%20Shift/main.py)
  This project shifts the RGB values (specified by user) in an image. It then saves it to a new file, '{filename}_rgbshifted.png'

- [OPUS to MP3 Converter](Misc%20Projects/OPUS%20to%20MP3%20Converter/main.py)

## Projects not added for whatever reason / Other Info
- I made a very small-scale chat application (very basic GUI, only sending messages and saving usernames functionality), but it has personal details in the code that cannot be removed.
  <br>[25/08/2024]
- There are 50+ additional projects that have not been included here.
